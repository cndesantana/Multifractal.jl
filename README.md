# Multifractal.jl
This library consists in a collection of different methods to calculate the multifractal variables of time series. The library presents methods for the following approaches:

1 - Chhabra-Jensen method

This approach, presented by Chhabra & Jensen (1989) [1], determines the multifractal spectra directly from the signal without using a Legendre transform.

2 - MFDMA

The MFDMA is an approach based detrended moving average (DMA) for multifractal analyses [2].

3 - MFDFA
